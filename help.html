<b>Basic Gameplay</b>

To start the game, each player is dealt 2 cards face down.
The player to the left of the dealer must bet half of the
minimum bet immediately. The next player must bet the
minimum bet. These mandatory upfront bets are called the
small and big blinds.

The player after the second blind can then choose to <b>call</b>
(bet the minimum), <b>raise</b> (bet more than the minimum), or
<b>fold</b> (not play this round).

Betting goes around the table. It is then time for the
"flop". Three cards are dealt face up. These are shared
amongst all players. For example, if you have a King and
another King comes up on the flop, then you have a pair of
Kings.

After the flop, there's another round of betting. Then, a
4th shared card is dealt face up. Then more betting.
Finally, a 5th shared card is dealt followed by a round of
betting.

Any players still in the game can then show their cards.
The player with the best 5-card hand is the winner.

<b>Order of Hands</b>

Only the best 5 cards play even though 7 are available to
each player. For example, if you hold a 4 and a 2 and then
the flop comes up 9,9,9,4,10...you have a full house nines
over fours.

This is a list of hands from best to worst.

<b>How to Play Texas Hold 'em Poker</b>

What's the best way to make a lot of money? There are all
kinds of theories on this, but it seems that experience is
the best thing to have. But here's some advice...Only play
a round if you really like your starting 2 cards. For
example A,K or K,K. Here's where high cards are best. If
you hold a pair of 7s, you might want to consider folding.

Other than that, be careful what you bet. Do you really
think that you have the best hand? Watch out for other
possibilities. Is someone trying for a Straight? A Flush?
Could they have Three of a Kind? A Full House??!?!!!!???.
No one ever has Four of a Kind.
